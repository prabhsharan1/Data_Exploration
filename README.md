# COVID-19 Data Exploration Project

This project focuses on exploring and analyzing COVID-19 data using Microsoft SQL Server. The goal is to gain insights into various aspects such as infection rates, death rates, and vaccination progress at both global and regional levels. The project utilizes a range of SQL techniques, including Joins, CTE's, Temp Tables, Window Functions, Aggregate Functions, Creating Views, Converting Data Types, to perform data exploration and analysis.

## Project Overview

### Skills Used
- Joins, CTE's, Temp Tables, Windows Functions, Aggregate Functions, Creating Views, Converting Data Types.

## SQL Queries

### 1. Data Retrieval
- Retrieve basic information from the dataset, filtering out records where the continent is null.

### 2. Likelihood of Death
- Calculate the likelihood of death if one contracts COVID-19 in a specific country.

### 3. Population Infected
- Calculate the percentage of the population infected with COVID-19.

### 4. Highest Infection Rate
- Identify countries with the highest infection rates compared to their population.

### ... and more
The project includes various other queries breaking down data by continent, showing global numbers, and examining the relationship between population and vaccinations.

### Visualization
To aid in data exploration and analysis, the project includes the creation of a view, 'PercentPopulationVaccinated,' storing data for later visualizations.
